Problem
===============================

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

    1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
    Thirty days has September,
    April, June and November.
    All the rest have thirty-one,
    Saving February alone,
    Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
    And on leap years, twenty-nine.
    A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

===============================
Solution
===============================

First I tried a subtraction algorithm by simply subtracting date1 from
date2 in order to find the number of days between 2 dates. I've become
obsessed with this algorithm since then. This didn't work because date1
month or day can be bigger than date2 month or day.

Then I tried a modified version where I fixed the days and months using
a "borrowing" principle from simple subtraction. I was off by a couple of
numbers and I could not figure out why.

Finally, I Googled and I decided to try it with Julian Day Numbers, the 
continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period.

    First compute # years (y) and # months (m) since March 1, -4800
    a = floor((14-month)/12)        # 1 for jan/feb, 0 for others
    y = year + 4800 - a             
    m = month + 12a - 3             # 0 for march, 11 for feb

    assume f() = floor()
    jdn = day + f((153m + 2)/5) + 365y + f(y/4) - f(y/100) + f(y/400) - 32045

This is a O(1) formula to keep days relative to one single date. I did
not come up with the algorithm, so I do feel guilty.

I figured out the solution in the middle (without calculating days between)
but I thought this problem was more fun. In this other solution, I would
find the starting day of year2 at jan1 and then count to that date to see
if it were a monday. I would do this for every 1st monday of a month for
the century.
