Problem
====================


If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

Solution
====================

In order to get the english versions of all numbers, I look at every
digit separately, keeping track of the place of the digit. Then I read
from an array the names of numbers 1-10, 10-19, 10-90 (by increments of 10)
and printed extras like "and" and hyphens between numbers.

One problem I found was in the teens because their classification relied
on the digits of two places instead of just one. I had to read from
the entire number in order to find these.

In order to determine whether I needed the "and" I also needed to look for
zeros in the ones and tens place.
