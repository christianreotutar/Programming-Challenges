====================
Problem
====================

Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers.

See input.txt for the digits

====================
Solution
====================

I started in Python a long time ago, finished in C++.

Added every character individually and then at the end added their
overflows from the least significant to the most. At the end, I counted
most significant digit + the digit in the following slots ( kind of 
cheating ).

C++ notes: You cannot cast a character to an int (i.e. from '0' -> 0),
you must instead subtract '0' from it. This is b/c characters are
represented in ASCII.

Strings are a standard library thing.
