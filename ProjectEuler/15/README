This problem is a counting problem and less of a programming problem.
Instead of using dynamic programming to count the number of routes
to move through this grid, you can take advantage of a few facts.

It is a 20x20 grid. This means to get from the top left corner to the
bottom right always requires 40 steps: 20 steps to the right, 20 steps
down.

This means that we only need to find the unique 20 of the 40 steps.
40 choose 20 is the answer.
